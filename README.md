Online Task Management System Project Objectives:

Develop a user-friendly Online Task Management System that allows individual users to manage their tasks efficiently.


Functional Requirements:

1.	User Registration and Authentication:
a)	Users should be able to register for an account with a unique username and password.
b)	Users should be able to log in securely to access their task lists.

2.	Task Management:
a)	Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
b)	Tasks can have a title, description, due date, and priority.
c)	Tasks can be organized into multiple task lists (e.g., personal, work).
d)	Users can mark tasks as complete.

3.	Task Lists:
a)	Users can create, edit, and delete task lists.
b)	Each task list can have a unique name.
c)	Users can switch between different task lists.

4.	User Profile:
a)	Users can view and update their profile information.
b)	Profile information may include name, email, and profile picture.

5.	Search and Filter:
a)	Users can search for tasks and task lists.
b)	Users can filter tasks based on priority, due date, or completion status.


Non-Functional Requirements:

1.	User Interface:
a)	The user interface should be intuitive and responsive, accessible on various devices.
b)	Modern design principles should be followed for a visually appealing user experience.

2.	Security:
a)	User data should be stored securely, including hashed passwords.
b)	Data transmission should be encrypted.
c)	Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) should be implemented.

3.	Performance:
a)	The system should provide fast response times for user interactions.
b)	Efficient database queries should be used to retrieve data.

4.	Scalability:
a)	The system should be designed to handle potential growth in the number of users and tasks.

5.	Documentation:
b)	Comprehensive user documentation should be provided.
c)	Code documentation and comments for developers should be maintained.

6.	Testing:
d)	Comprehensive testing should be performed, including unit testing and integration testing.
e)	User acceptance testing should be conducted to ensure usability.


Constraints and Assumptions:
1.	The system will be developed using Angular (TypeScript) for the front end and ASP.NET Core for the back end.
2.	The project will have a defined budget and timeline.
3.	The system will be hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., Azure).
4.	Users are assumed to have basic internet connectivity and web browser access.
